## Description

This is a social network application programming interface (API). When you initiate the application by issuing a command, the server will start running, and the data models will be synchronized with the MongoDB database.

When you utilize Insomnia, a tool for testing APIs, to access the GET routes for retrieving user and thought data, the information for each route will be presented in a well-structured JSON format.

By using Insomnia to test the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes of the API, you can effectively create, update, and delete users and thoughts within the database.

When you perform tests on the API's POST and DELETE routes using Insomnia, you can create and delete reactions to thoughts, as well as add or remove friends from a user's friend list.
