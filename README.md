## Description

It is a social network application programming interface (API), so <br/>
When you enter a command to start the application,
Then the  server will begin running, and the data models will be synchronized with the MongoDB database.

When using Insomnia (a tool for testing APIs) to access the GET routes for retrieving user and thought data,
Then the information for each route will be shown in a well-organized JSON format.

If using Insomnia to test the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes of the API,
Then you can successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database.

When testing the API's POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia,
Then you can create and delete reactions to thoughts, as well as add or remove friends from a user's friend list.
